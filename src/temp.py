Been DAOing his heart out since 2015.\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\nMissions under this intent should work to make the Optimism Collective widely known as an ecosystem that fosters public goods and regenerative finance ‚Äì an ecosystem ultimately working towards the creation of a new economic model. Increased awareness should onboard new people, DAOs, builders, and partners who are passionate about our vision and values to the ecosystem, some of which may be outside Web3.\nThis grant proposal aims to spread awareness of the optimistic vision within the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystem by developing a comprehensive 3-month educational course to turn impact projects into DAOs on Optimism. The course will empower public goods-focused projects to establish their own Impact DAOs, leveraging attestations & soul-bound tokens on Optimism to drive positive social and environmental impact.\nThrough targeted educational resources, workshops, and community-building initiatives, this grant will advance the understanding and adoption of decentralized governance and regenerative finance, contributing to the growth of the concept that impact = profit and creating opportunity for new economic models to grow on Optimism.\nIf this grant is funded, nonprofit/public goods-focused projects from inside and outside the web3 space will have an easy path towards becoming a DAO on Optimism. Below are a few selected projects that our team has shortlisted to be part of the course program so far.\nThese projects have expressed great interest to be part of the first cohort:\nDiamante Luz Center for Regenerative Living\nAn eco-village of nomadic co-creators at the beginning stages of development with many opportunities for regenerative investment for the benefit of future generations. Their aim is integration of permaculture and shared common land-based resources.\nUrbanika and the SolarPunk awakening\nImmersive school teaching about the intersection of Web 3.0 and regenerative urban governance. They use innovative methods of teaching to bring inspiration and knowledge on alternative ways of governance, management, and relating through their education program.\nReCommon\nThey focus on larger projects that combine the community land trust model of land tenure with regenerative agriculture, permaculture, natural building, rural development, good urbanism and web3 technology to support the resilient place-based communities of our future.\nVivero\nVivero serves as a community-funded treasury, enabling participatory budgeting and community-led giving and grantmaking toward individuals, fellowships, projects, and social enterprises. By leveraging a community investment (staking) position as a ground layer for their grantmaking pool and community treasury allows Vivero to be regenerative.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nOur organization has incredible access to experts in the space. There are very few DAO experts with higher regard than our founder Griff Green. Because of our long history and connections to rescuing TheDAO, Parity Multisig, and various other at-risk funds in Ethereum, we have a wide network of smart contract experts and general web3 experts across all disciplines.\nThe course will consist of interactive workshops led by experienced web3 practitioners such as Griff Green, Livia & Tam from Commons Stack, Zakku from Coordinape, Michael Zargham & Jeff Emmett from Blockscience, and others depending on their availability. Workshops will be well-prepared and include group exercises on Miro boards.\nPlease list the critical milestone(s) that should be tracked to determine if you should receive your grant in one year: Critical milestone(s) demonstrates the proposal has been executed (a clawback is possible for failure to execute on critical milestones)\nThe full breakdown can be reviewed here:\nMilestone 1\nCritical\nDevelop a system for giving attestations for all the donors on Giveth.\nEst Delivery: Aug 23\nTotal cost: 15,000 OP\nMilestone 2\nCritical\nEnable DAOs to manage their project with their DAO, including donations, updates, and project descriptions.\nEst Delivery: Sept 6\nTotal cost: 7500 OP\nMilestone 3\nCritical\nCreate a way for people with attestations to claim reputation tokens on Optimism on their Giveth Project page. Projects that want to launch an Impact DAO can opt in to distribute reputation tokens to those who donate (and get an attestation from Giveth) as well as for other attestations and the tokens would be claimed via the Giveth Project page on Optimism.\nEst Delivery: Sept 20\nTotal cost: 7500 OP\nMilestone 4\nCritical\nHave a finalized outline of the syllabus and course work and have at least 1 rough cut of a course completed, and all the infrastructure work done so we can execute on the course.\nEst Delivery: Sept 20\nOP Reward: 60,000 OP\nThe above milestones are what we can complete before the Sept 20th deadline. The following we intend to do after Sept 20th:\nMilestone 5\nConduct workshops and 1-on-1 sessions to ensure that we have an alpha cohort of nonprofits that are fully prepared to participate in the program.\nEst Delivery: Oct 18\nMilestone 6\nSoft launch the coursework with the video training program and give our alpha cohort of nonprofits hands-on instruction to ensure that they are fully prepared to participate in the program and get feedback on how the course can be improved. Anyone will have access to the coursework, but we will not promote it.\nEst Delivery: Oct 25\nMilestone 7\nRevise the materials as needed and publish the finalized coursework in our web portal and promote it. Well-documented course materials including final video lectures from the 3-month course will be available on our webportal. Future public goods projects can complete the interactive coursework on this website and launch their Impact DAOs.\nEst Delivery: Feb 21\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.\nThis ambitious undertaking unites multiple teams, project managers, and industry experts with a shared mission to create a lasting and transformative impact. Through this project, our aim is to cultivate a comprehensive knowledge base that empowers future public goods entities to confidently launch their own DAOs and navigate the Optimism ecosystem with ease.\nTo embark on this grand project, Giveth relies on the support of Optimism. With this grant, we envision the launch of a project that will not only attract more public goods initiatives to the network but also spread the optimistic vision to a broader audience, inspiring greater participation and collaboration. Our team has more DAO experience than nearly anyone in the web 3.0 ecosystem and with your support, we strive to spread our knowledge and help more projects and public goods to benefit from these economic and governance models.\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson‚Äôs impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\nThe current plan for the syllabus of the course can be reviewed here, but it is likely to change drastically as the DAO space moves very quickly: Impact DAO training course 1\nThe tangible results and deliverables per each milestone will be publicly online and available based on the course timeline outlined in the document.\nFor measurable success criteria, we should consider the use of attestations on Giveth and the success rates through the course:\nNumber of attestations for donors on Giveth\nNumber of attestations given by Giveth projects for contributing in non-financial ways\nNumber of projects that are using DAOs to manage their Giveth project\nNumber of visitors to the course‚Äôs web portal\nNumber of projects that started the course independently of Giveth‚Äôs direct support\nNumber of projects that started the course with of Giveth‚Äôs support\nNumber of projects that started the course independently of Giveth‚Äôs direct support\nNumber of projects that presented an Impact DAO design\nNumber of projects that completed the course\nNumber of projects that successfully launched an Impact DAO on Optimism\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: Yes\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes',

Great to see you‚Äôre thinking about driving impact on Optimism.\nGuil:\nThis grant proposal aims to spread awareness of the optimistic vision within the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystem by developing a comprehensive 3-month educational course for public goods projects. The course will empower public goods-focused projects to establish their own Impact DAOs, leveraging soul-bound tokens on Optimism to drive positive social and environmental impact. Through targeted educational resources, workshops, and community-building initiatives, this grant will advance the understanding and adoption of decentralized governance and regenerative finance, contributing to the growth of the concept that impact = profit and new economic models within Optimism and Ethereum.\nThis introduction is very focused on the educational course that will be provided, while later sections go into way more detail on technical implications (e.g ‚ÄúTechnical infrastructure for Token Reputation distribution‚Äù, ‚Äúback-end and front-end developers, UX designer, project manager, QA & testers‚Äù).\nIt seems like Milestone 5 ‚ÄúFinalization and launching the course work‚Äù is making up a lot of the work for this mission. I think it would be worth clarifying if the goal here is to run a 3-month course with ca. 5 impact DAOs, or if the goal is to publish an online course to reach many more projects.\nGuil:\nSelection and Preparation of Nonprofits with SBTs: We will select and prepare nonprofits to participate in the program, which will include creating SBTs on Optimism and set them up with a governance portal (e.g. Agora or Snapshot) for their respective organizations.\nThat‚Äôs cool, would strongly recommend SBT leverage the Attestation Station 1 so they‚Äôre interoperable with the impact/reputation system in Optimism governance!\nOn ‚ÄúHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?‚Äù:\nHere some measurable success criteria could be helpful, e.g. number of projects that completed the course, number of projects that presented an impact DAO design, number of projects that successfully launched an impact DAO, visitors of the interactive website, etc.',

I think it would be worth clarifying if the goal here is to run a 3-month course with ca. 5 impact DAOs, or if the goal is to publish an online course to reach many more projects.\nThe goal is to launch the video course for all to use and to reach projects we are not in touch with. This will be a webportal and we will add some features to Giveth, both of which will need solid UX research and dev execution (our audience is only web3 curious, not web3 native so it takes some thought! But we have demand from a few projects on Giveth so we want to work closely with those 5 future-DAOs to validate the course and make updates to the course if needed. We can try to make that more clear. Thank you for the feedback!\nJonas:\nThat‚Äôs cool, would strongly recommend SBT leverage the Attestation Station so they‚Äôre interoperable with the impact/reputation system in Optimism governance!\nGreat idea! We can absolutely do that! I think we can add it in without increasing the cost, because it should be pretty easy to add an attestation step to our SBT distribution. It wasn‚Äôt included originally because we haven‚Äôt found a way to vote with attestations yet, and we want them to have functional DAOs on Optimism, but adding attestations at the start will future proof the project for sure, and actually I think we can add attestations for all Giveth donors, and then allow SBTs to be claimed by people with attestations. That would be a nice flow.\nJonas:\nOn ‚ÄúHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?‚Äù:\nHere some measurable success criteria could be helpful, e.g. number of projects that completed the course, number of projects that presented an impact DAO design, number of projects that successfully launched an impact DAO, visitors of the interactive website, etc.\nGood call, those are obvious metrics that we should include!

It enables us to have a baseline for the generation of reputation tokens that can come from financial and nonfinancial contributions. Eventually we can make the Giveth project page mint reputation tokens based on a variety of attestations.\nAlso thank you @Jonas for the suggestions on the benchmark question, we realized that we misinterpreted what was being asked in that question and that we could really improve the format of the proposal.\nThe total amount requested is the same but we broke up a few of the milestones to be more granular and clear about what we are delivering. So while it may look like the proposal has changed a lot, the project‚Äôs output has not changed in any material way, other than the addition of attestations on Giveth.',

However much of that impact is largely unknown for the following reasons:\nThe builders we fund are strong builders, but not necessarily marketers.\nWe haven‚Äôt had the infrastructure to automate a decentralized marketing function.\nThus, stories of Optimism builders go mostly untold; their impact unknown.\nThis Mission aims to provide the needed infrastructure and support to spread awareness of the Optimistic Vision:\nWe leverage ThriveCoin and the Thrive Protocol to automate, scale, and bring on-chain the entire contribution incentive, validation, and rewards processes.\nWe work with the Ambassador Program to incentive contributors capable of producing and marketing high-quality content.\nWe work with the Optimism Foundation, top delegates, and top contributors to ensure Ambassadors are making truly valuable contributions.\nContributions will be focused around researching, creating, and sharing the stories of the 300+ Optimism 2and RPGF 1 funded 1 projects.\nWe will create a content framework (‚Äúpath‚Äù) that guides proper research, content creation, and content marketing.\nWhile the Mission is ongoing, we will look at data + feedback from the community to constantly evolve the initiative to achieve agreed upon metrics.\nWe expect our proposed Mission to create significant impact:\nIt will amplify the work of the Ambassador Program, automating the onboarding, mobilizing, and incentivizing of Ambassadors.\nIt will inspire the research, creation, and marketing of an anthology of real-world use cases of the tangible impact of our Optimistic Vision.\nIt will incentivize builders even more - because they will get free marketing and exposure for their work and impact.\nIt will clarify for badgeholders the impact of Optimism-funded projects, thereby allowing them to make more informed decisions on future funding.\nWhile a one-time Mission, this provides a potential long-term solution for this and other endeavors that can be fine-tuned Season after Season.\nBelow is a draft of contributions we propose to incentivize existing and new ambassadors to make in service of our Mission. This path will evolve based on feedback before launch - and it will continue to evolve each week as we integrate real-time data and community feedback. A more detailed view of the draft can be found here 2\n\nNote: We may incorporate other educational content outlined in other mission proposals as part of the ambassador on-boarding process 2 as our aim is to quickly get new contirbutors up to speed as quickly as possible. One such example may be Bankless Academy‚Äôs proposal in which they outline the creation of a retroPGF course\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nExperience and Representation in the Optimism Collective\nThe members of this alliance are all significant contributors to the Optimism Collective. We are familiar with its structure and inner workings. We will be able to provide insights of contributing Optimism Collectives. Our experience includes:\nAmbassadors\nOptimism Foundation\nGovernance Delegates\nThriveCoin Team\nThe Alliance Members will collaborate with the ThriveCoin team to:\nDefine initial contributions and associated incentives.\nRefine contributions, validations, and incentives based on data and feedback.\nProvide any and all additional needed support to ensure Mission success.\nThe Alliance role requires 1 to 3 hours of work a week. If all milestones are achieved within season 4, Alliance members will receive up to 6k OP in compensation in total.\nAny Alliance members already being compensated by the Optimism Foundation will not receive any portion of the grant.\nAbout ThriveCoin\nThe ThriveCoin team has deep expertise supporting communities at scale in driving impact through behavior change. Our web3 background is in supporting DAOs like Bankless, ApeCoin, Aavegotchi, and ShapeShift.\nIn addition, our leadership has previously scaled products and protocols to support millions of users, and we‚Äôve worked together to support organizations like Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, and more.\nTo support this vision, we are providing both the technology needed to automate, scale, and bring on-chain an entire contributor path for the Ambassador program, and ongoing expert guidance and support to ensure our shared success.\nThriveCoin currently supports ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, Aavegotchi DAO, ShapeShift 1, Polygon Village (revealed soon), and other top DAO communities. We are web3 natives, funded by top web3 VCs, and have been collaborating for months with Optimism members to ensure this proposal is aligned with community needs.\nAs an example of our work, we just finished ApeCoin DAO - Season 1. We experienced broad adoption and increased core user engagement across the DAO, seeing more than a doubling 2 of core engagement metrics.\n** Please list a critical milestone.

I‚Äôve been intimately involved in building this Mission from the start (e.g. months), so hopefully I‚Äôm qualified to answer your question about ‚Äúhow ThriveCoin features in this plan‚Äù:\n1. We are the protocol: Our Thrive Protocol automates and brings on-chain the entire contribution incentive, validation, and rewards processes supporting this Mission. It makes everything that happens in this Mission scalable and transparent. The tech is groundbreaking; it‚Äôs a big reason we were recently invested in by top web3 VCs.\n2. We are the builders: This Mission requires significant custom product / application support - from the Thank Optimism community page and apps to custom ways to contribute that require custom Optimism contribution apps. We are already, pre-vote, building all of this for Optimism (we needed to front-load much of the work given the tight turnaround between the vote and launch).\n3. We are the expertise and support: This Mission requires the collaboration and partnership of a team of experts. We support communities like ApeCoin, ShapeShift, Aavegotchi, and Bankless, and others with our protocol and similar deployments. Additionally, before ThriveCoin, our core leadership team worked together to provide similar kinds of support to Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, Cisco, etc.\nIn short, ThriveCoin is end-to-end working together with the Alliance - at all levels - to ensure that the impact we achieve together is the impact we seek.\nThank you for your question, Jack. If you - or anyone else - have any other questions, brainstorms, anything, I‚Äôm happy to address here, or I‚Äôd love to connect personally too.\nDaniel / daniel@thrivecoin.com',

Let‚Äôs thrive!\n@Tjark thank you so much for your kind words. Also, we really appreciate your questions. Below are some quick answers:\nWe have five layers of bot, bad actor, and sybil protection. An example of one layer is that we built the infrastructure to support both known and unknown validation mechanisms for each way to contribute. For example, if a way to contribute is ‚Äúcreate original content from a research template‚Äù the known auto-validation might be to submit content for review via a form. The unknown validation mechanism(s) are created by the Alliance and known only to them. They exist to maintain the integrity of the process and ensure nobody can game the system. This is just one layer of protection. There are five!\nContent verification works differently in each of the communities we work with. Generally, though, for each desired type of content, the Alliance will communicate criteria that they are looking for - e.g. quality, format, etc. There are more automated ways to review content and less automated ways to review content, and we can support both. What I know about this Alliance is that they are, in your words, ‚Äúall-stars‚Äù. So I too am quite excited to see where they start and how it evolves as we get feedback and data from the community.\n(This wasn‚Äôt a question of yours, but it follows your last question): Executing on this Mission well means building a kind of ‚Äúevolutionary system.‚Äù The community will give us lots of feedback about what works and doesn‚Äôt work. On a weekly basis, the Alliance (with support from ThriveCoin) will be looking at that feedback - and accompanying data - and making adjustments. They will add new ways to contribute, shift reward amounts based on supply and demand, and so on. Each week, we will learn and improve‚Ä¶ learn and improve. This is how we will, together, create enduring impact.',

It seems the cleanest way to address it all is to directly quote and respond.\njackanorak:\nSo the idea here is, more or less, to give contributors OP tokens in a year for work they do today?\nThe idea is to reward people for truly valuable contributions they make to the Optimism Collective - and in doing so spread awareness of the Optimistic Vision.\nIt is important to separate out the one-year hold period. That is not a decision of the Alliance for this Mission. It is a DAO-wide decision about how best to allocate certain grants.\njackanorak:\nWhat wil you do if you find you don‚Äôt have enough participation? Will the mission be aborted, or would there be a backup plan to incentivize activity?\nPeople are rewarded only when they make valuable contributions that help spread awareness of the Optimistic Vision. In other words, this Mission is entirely performance-based. There is no risk to Optimism of losing what is not rewarded.\njackanorak:\nAnd I see that there‚Äôs a promise to give back OP if it hasn‚Äôt been distributed to capacity. Will the same be true of ThriveCoin and Alliance members‚Äô allocations?\nAs part of this Mission, we confirmed that our ‚Äúgrant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones‚Äù. If we hit the critical milestones, we receive our portion of the grant; if we don‚Äôt, there is a clawback provision in place.\n** NOTE: We have been making - and will continue to make - significant investments in this Mission (we had to start building early because of the quick turnaround time). Additionally, even upon achieving critical milestones, we are still subject to a one-year hold period. In other words, even if / when we create immense value for Optimism, ThriveCoin doesn‚Äôt get rewarded for a long, long time. We want to make this investment in the Optimism community because we share deep values and vision alignment, and because we believe, together, we can help drive significant value to Optimism.\njackanorak:\nYou can use liquid $THRIVE, as you always have in the past\nThis is not accurate. ThriveCoin can reward communities with a Testnet THRIVE token, but this was mostly done with smaller, early communities. Since then, community members shared clear, consistent feedback: they prefer to rewarded with their community tokens - or tokens they know and value.\nThe norm now is to reward with tokens valued by the community. ApeCoin is rewarding with APE. Aavegotchi will (mostly) be rewarding with GHST. ShapeShift is rewarding with OP. Even Bankless, wants to, soon, transition to rewarding with BANK. Going forward, we expect this trend to continue.\njackanorak:\nAs I read this review:\nhttps://twitter.com/singularityhack/status/1645786536934518788?s=20\nit seems that the secret sauce was Thrivecoin‚Äôs ability to compensate people directly through the creation of a native token.\nI appreciate your perspective. This isn‚Äôt how I read the review, nor is it what I consider our secret sauce.\nOur secret sauce, based on lots of feedback, seems to be: a) our ability to operationalize DAO contributions by automating and bringing on-chain valuable community contributions, and b) our ability to help communities drive tangible impact at scale.\njackanorak:\nDoes this person writing the review have any previous relationship with you or with Bankless DAO?\nI assume you are asking about conflicts. This person is a leader at Polygon Village. He is a Bankless DAO member, which is how he became familiar with ThriveCoin. He does not - nor has he ever - worked for ThriveCoin.\njackanorak:\nmore broadly, can you describe the relationship ThriveCoin has with Bankless DAO, past or present? Do they have any interest in your initiatives?\nI again assume you are asking about conflicts. Bankless DAO is / was a community we serve - our first! We have no partnership beyond a community relationship. Bankless DAO has no ownership in ThriveCoin. They are not connected to this Mission.\njackanorak:\nwhy not position this for an RPGF grant?\nAll members of this Alliance are better suited than me to answer your question - due to their deep experience with Optimism. But I‚Äôll try to answer, as I‚Äôve been in extensive conversations with them and many others at Optimism for months:\nIntent 3 is about Spreading Awareness of the Optimistic Vision. Two of the ways Optimism is currently accomplishing this are:\nThe development of an Ambassador program to help actively spread awareness, and\nThe funding of hundreds of projects that, through their work and success supporting public goods, help organically spread awareness.\nThis Mission helps BOTH incentivize the expansion of the Ambassador Program AND clarify / share the impact of hundreds of projects already funded by Optimism. In other words, it deeply embodies the essence of Intent 3 in ways the Optimism community has already expressed that it values.\nFinal thoughts Thank you, Jack, for all of your questions and thoughts. I‚Äôve sought to address all of it, step by step. I hope this is helpful, and I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate and together drive significant impact for Optimism and all of web3. - Daniel',

Will the mission be aborted, or would there be a backup plan to incentivize activity?\nGood question, the secret sauce here is that the engine providing this content is an army of highly motivated content creators in the Ambassador program.\nTLDR is that the Ambassador‚Äôs have been creating content for Optimism long before retroPGF #2 was even announced [ambassador collection].\nThe reason I mention this is because the ambassadors pre-retroPGF #2 were creating content with no expectation of reward. They and by extension I, did it out of a love for Optimism.\nPrevious to submitting this proposal we ran a simple retroPGF content quest for the ambassador program. This quest ran for 25 days and yielded 79 content submissions (each account was only allowed one submission) using just a simple content submission guide and a couple links to resources.\nQuestN\nRetroPGF2: Project Specific Content\nQuests with splendid rewards on QuestN, hit the link to participate!\nIn addition to this we had a new content quest that dropped today for the Ambassador‚Äôs about 6 hours ago (to align with the retroPGF round 3 announcement) and this has already received 5 content submissions. Each submission requires a cumbersome manual review process. Partnering with ThriveCoin saves us from this process and a host of other cumbersome processes preventing the Ambassador program from scaling.\nThis mission proposal is just the first step in really unlocking the true value of the Ambassador program through scalability as once we have the ambassador contribution path automated on ThriveCoin we are able to define those future contributions as anything we would like. This in turn creates a powerful marketing apparatus for the Optimism Collective for any and all future endeavors.\nAdditional Context for the Ambassador Program:\n-The Ambassador program consists of 42 ambassadors and well over 1000+ wannabe-ambassadors.\n-The number of wannabe-ambassadors is a good gauge of overall interest in the Ambassador program. This number has gone from ~1000 to 1300 over the last month or so.\nI would encourage everyone to head to the Optimism Discord, grab the wannabe-ambassador role and check out the Ambassador channels. Here you can see how active and engaged the community really is. Directions on how to do this is outlined in the Ambassador-req doc found in our community docs here',

Here‚Äôs some examples of published work\nTo Incentivize or Not: Impact of Blockchain-Based Cryptoeconomic Tokens on Human Information-Sharing Behavior 1\nImpact Financing 1\nToken Bonding Curve Design Parameters 1\nSystemModelling 1\nDoes Your Product Need a Token 1\nFoundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems 1\nToken Design Mental Models 1\nEach represents about 8 hours of work including research, draft and editorial review, scheduling, publishing and coordination. Work comparable to this project in that we were representing other people‚Äôs work which demands attention to quality.\nWhile I value the diversity of perspective that ambassadors bring to the collective imo they would be better supporting and promoting this type of content than crafting it. Why? because representing other peoples work is akin to Brand Communication which is known to require consistent messaging.\nWhat the three month trial proved was that\nEditorial oversight is essential when developing content that represents other peoples work (potentially brand identity) and to build trust and authority in the publishers brand\nDue to the quality assurance process, coordination overhead increased in direct proportion to the number of contributors. (this is where tooling can help scale)\nUltimately that fewer, highly qualified contributors is the most effective, efficient means to assure high quality content.\nWhich is not to say that the results will be the same here but that it would be worth testing the concept before scaling.\nAs a possible alternative to deliver the same results I would suggest you test the proposed program at a much smaller scale first to develop the onboarding process, content strategy, quality assurance processes and policies with a small inital cohort before looking to scale. I‚Äôm happy to share the frameworks and policies developed earlier this year and would also highly recommend the Bankless writers cohort model, which informed the trial at TE Academy.\nI would estimate a team of 5 FTE equivalent writers + editor w. AI & publishing support could produce the same results - in terms of content and process development - as herein proposed at significantly lower coordination overhead.

In the past, whether with THRIVE or client protocol tokens, I assume all rewards given out have been liquid, no?\nThanks for the further clarification. It‚Äôs an understandable concern. Broadened, it‚Äôs basically: how do locked (rather than liquid) token grants influence a person / project‚Äôs willingness or ability to create value for Optimism?\nIt looks like we‚Äôre aligned on a hypothesis: it must have some limiting effect. Additionally, it‚Äôs probably most limiting for people we all care a lot about - people who want to contribute, but can‚Äôt without access to liquid token rewards.\nStill, these are the rules of the game that we‚Äôre working with. We have our eyes wide open that there are some limitations. But that doesn‚Äôt change our focus. Limitations always exist. We believe:\nAny limitations makes it more - rather than less - necessary to have a Mission that actively values, honors, and incentivizes important contributions.\nOptimism still has a ton going for it, and people want to help. You can see that in the rise of Wannabe Ambassadors. We‚Äôll incentivize them to help more in ways that create more value.\nAdditionally, the Alliance believes - as do I - that the community will be more incentivized by locked OP than by Testnet THRIVE - or any other token they have no relationship to.

Small world. just got off a great call with Willy. We are still early - just two weeks or so into deployment. They already have 165 contributors (which requires having a GitCoin Passport score of 17 or higher)! Over the next few weeks, we - together with ShapeShift - can share a bunch more. We feel confident it‚Äôll be another strong case study.\njackanorak:\nthrivegiraffe:\nThis Mission helps BOTH incentivize the expansion of the Ambassador Program AND clarify / share the impact of hundreds of projects already funded by Optimism. In other words, it deeply embodies the essence of Intent 3 in ways the Optimism community has already expressed that it values.\nAbsolutely. Do you have prior examples of the kinds of incentivized work you‚Äôre discussing here ‚Äì are you imagining things like this? I also invite @jrocki.bedrock or some others in the Alliance to weigh in here.\nI‚Äôll quote jrocki to share a bit on what the Alliance is imagining:\njrocki.bedrock:\nthrivegiraffe:\nThere will be four Contribution ‚ÄúPaths‚Äù (sets of contributions): Onboarding, Research, Create, and Market. A draft of ways to contribute that would be incentivized in the Contribution Paths is available here . It‚Äôs also linked in the proposal above.\n@jackanorak to add additional context,\nThe mission‚Äôs central goal is to shine a spotlight on projects receiving grants or retroPGF through telling each projects individual story and outlining value they have provided to the collective. Below is a short desc. of how each set of contributions help accomplish the above missions goal:\nOnboard - Incentives to bring new ambassadors into the program and enables them to gather the context they need in order to create valuable content in the future\nResearch - research is key to creating high quality content, here we want to enable creators to research projects and submit templates of their research which other creators can then leverage to create content from.\nCreate/Market (might combine as they are for our intents and purposes the same) - Giving creators the option to leverage another‚Äôs research to create content we believe will increase the amount of content per project being generated.\n*The detail of each contribution will be defined by the alliance members which include 3 ambassadors - me (Ambassador program lead), Michael and Subli.\nIn addition to the above, while this specific Mission is unique to Optimism and Optimism needs, ThriveCoin has experience addressing many of the ways to contribute linked above that are desired.\nMore importantly, our tech is built to support the auto-validation of any of theoretically millions of ways to contribute to a community. In other words, it‚Äôs designed to be agnostic about the specific desired way to contribute or the specific platform, and to allow us to support community needs.\nAlso, the specifics of this particular Mission happen to be a sweet spot for me and much of our tech leadership tech team. I ran - and they helped lead - an organization that helped employees at companies like Google, Microsoft, Citi, etc. tell and hear powerful stories at scale about experiences that elucidated company values. We built interesting technology to help leaders and employees at those organizations better understand the impact and learning from those stories.\nI hope this is helpful. As always, I‚Äôm here for more as is needed! - Daniel',

Beating these milestones would do even more. Yes, this would be evidence of the beginning of scale.\nlee0007:\nI was recently contracted to lead a three month trial for community sourced content. Here‚Äôs some examples of published work\nCongratulations on your work. I appreciate a good soft shill!\nlee0007:\nWhile I value the diversity of perspective that ambassadors bring to the collective imo they would be better supporting and promoting this type of content than crafting it. Why? because representing other peoples work is akin to Brand Communication which is known to require consistent messaging.\nI do not share your opinion.\nI believe that in every community, members have unique skills, talents, and attributes that deserve to be seen, valued, and rewarded. This belief seems to be shared by DAO communities as a whole. The experiment of DAOs is literally decentralization - not the kind of centralization you propose.\nI get that you believe that most DAO members ‚Äúwould be better supporting and promoting‚Äù content created by a small, centralized group of content creators. I don‚Äôt. I strongly believe the Optimism community is much more capable than you are giving it credit for.\nlee0007:\nWhat the three month trial proved was that\nThere‚Äôs a big difference between learning and proving. You did a trial - not with us and probably without appropriate tooling. You learned some things, based on your experience. It‚Äôll support you in evolving and being better next time. But you haven‚Äôt proven anything. You learned. That‚Äôs good!\nlee0007:\nEditorial oversight is essential when developing content that represents other peoples work (potentially brand identity) and to build trust and authority in the publishers brand\nDue to the quality assurance process, coordination overhead increased in direct proportion to the number of contributors. (this is where tooling can help scale)\nUltimately that fewer, highly qualified contributors is the most effective, efficient means to assure high quality content.\nI agree editorial oversight is important. (your first opinion)\nI agree that without proper tooling it is hard to ‚Äúcoordinate‚Äù more contributors (your second opinion).\nI disagree with your conclusion that the most effective way to achieve high quality content is to abandon the values of decentralization that the community stands for. (In your words ‚Äúfewer, highly qualified contributors is the most effective, efficient means to assure high quality content.‚Äù)\nHere‚Äôs different data: In our latest initiative with ApeCoin, we‚Äôve spent the past few weeks incentivizing decentralized artists to create art that embodies the phrase ‚ÄúApe In: The Future of ApeCoin.‚Äù\nMore than 100 artists shared their art.\nThe art is shockingly powerful (it‚Äôs been shared and retweeted many thousands of times).\nThe art reflects the truly decentralized contributions of an inspired community.\nI feel confident five centralized artists managed by a person couldn‚Äôt have come up with the variety and quality of art shared in the contest - nor would they have been able to drive the reach.\n** You can see some of the art by scrolling on the Thank Ape Twitter feed here 1. Semi-finalists were just announced by the Thank APE board (their version of an Alliance) two hours ago.\nlee0007:\nI would estimate a team of 5 FTE equivalent writers + editor w. AI & publishing support could produce the same results - in terms of content and process development - as herein proposed at significantly lower coordination overhead.\nAs noted above, I respect your opinion - and strongly disagree.\nAdditionally, if further centralization is the solution to the growing pains of decentralization, DAOs have a bigger problem to worry about. Luckily, my experience leads me to believe there is a better solution than back-steps to more centralization. We can simple get better at decentralization!\nI‚Äôve seen - and been a part of - well-organized decentralized community contributions. Yes, it‚Äôs imperfect. Yes, there‚Äôs still a lot of learning. But there is immense value being created‚Ä¶ and this is still just the beginning. There‚Äôs so much more to come! - Daniel',

AI & publishing support could produce the same results - in terms of content and process development - as herein proposed at significantly lower coordination overhead. Ambassador could support this work through translation, memes, creative and design elements and to share and promote the content.\nFirstly I must say I love your pfp. Your Optimist pfp coupled with your thoughtful comments on community content scaling tell me that you too believe social decentralization is incredibly important.\nI believe the above is a good plan if we are trying to scale a centralized marketing team. Our approach here in scaling a decentralized marketing team is to start with the decentralized marketing team (Ambassadors) right from the start. This ensures we are able to iterate with them as we go. I.E processes that work for a centralized marketing team may not work and or scale for a decentralized one.\nSpeaking of iteration I believe we have a strong contribution path format to begin with which has already been iterated on based upon on learnings since the ambassador program inception.\nIn a previous reply I summarized the logical approach we took in structuring the contribution path.\nI will admit the contribution path as outlined may not be perfect when put into practical use so we will need to learn and iterate as we go. This is where ThriveCoin plays a crucial role by providing us insightful data inside a tight feedback loop which will allow us to quickly iterate on the contribution path in real time.\nI would love to have a conversation with you to share a bit about the ambassador program as well as discuss some of your work as well.

In addition, I believe you need a strategic plan to ensure quality, performance and impact, especially at the scale proposed.\nAbout 2,500 years ago, Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu wrote ‚ÄúThe Art of War.‚Äù In it, he said, ‚ÄúStrategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.‚Äù Tactics and strategy are not at odds with one another‚Äîthey‚Äôre on the same team‚Ä¶Strategy describes the destination [why] and how you are going to get there, and tactics describe the specific actions you are going to take along the way Source\nDecentralization I‚Äôm suggesting could begin at the green circle and deliver the same proposed outcomes with 8 - 16 people.

I‚Äôll do my best to address your additional feedback:\n1.‚ÄúTactics without strategic is the noise before defeat‚Äù: You make generalized points that we are being tactical and not strategic - and use bold Sun Tzu quotes to do it. What you say is not accurate.\nThe Alliance is a well-known group of highly strategic and impact oriented people. Additionally, top DAO communities trust ThriveCoin because we are builders and community strategists. In addition to large strategic deployments with top DAOs, our leadership team has worked - at a strategic level - with Google, Citi, KPMG, top governments and top NGOs. Our expertise - for decades - is strategic deployments for both large centralized and decentralized communities.\nYou seem, for now, to disagree with us on strategy. That doesn‚Äôt mean we have no strategy - it just means we disagree. It appears you believe the road to better content is a smaller, more centralized, and less automated approach. We believe your suggestion is a stopgap road that may or may not support real decentralization or drive significant impact. We believe - and we are compiling growing data sets to show it - that a better path to decentralization is a results-base approach that leverages the best of community, automation, and the blockchain.\n‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt measure you can‚Äôt manage‚Äù: This is a bold and catchy, and you repeat it in different ways. But you are incorrectly applying it to us.\nThere are clear impact measurements included in this Mission. Additionally, we‚Äôve written a lot in this thread about the (measurable) impact we‚Äôve driven for others and can help drive for Optimism. We‚Äôve also shared data from recent deployments and we‚Äôve shared testimonials.\nYou haven‚Äôt responded to any of this - but you‚Äôve continued to repeat your claims.\nA more supportive approach with your feedback would be offering guiding suggestions to help us improve our Mission. For example, what are specific impact metrics would you like us to measure that you don‚Äôt see? We‚Äôd love to incorporate some of your ideas!\n‚ÄúCoordination overhead outstrips the resulting impact‚Äù: I agree with your set of concerns around this (alignment!). If I were to turn your concerns into a question it might be: ‚ÄúHey Alliance‚Ä¶ or Daniel‚Ä¶ how do you plan on managing increasingly complex coordination needs at scale?‚Äù\nWe have a lot of experiencing addressing this need. Here‚Äôs an abbreviated answer:\nWe clarify and automate validations of ways to contribute that enable scaling and impedes bots and bad actors (tech + the Alliance).\nWe incentivize best practices building and template building to help communities better understand what works and what scales.\nWe analyze engagement data, impact data, and community feedback weekly.\nBased on learning, the Alliance evolves ways to contribute, validation mechanisms, reward amounts, and more. Then they get more data, learn more, rinse, and repeat!\nLast thoughts: I really do appreciate your engagement @lee0007. It‚Äôs clear that you care and that you love to put together content. I believe there are many ways you can work with us - and hopefully with many others at Optimism - to help make this Mission a huge success!\nSpecifically, I appreciate and agree with nearly all of your bullet points at the end of your last post. It seems you understand them as contrasting with Mission. You might be pleasantly surprised to learn these thoughts are generally aligned with the Alliance‚Äôs thinking!\nPerhaps soon we might find that there‚Äôs much deeper alignment here than first suspected. Some of our most diehard supporters today questioned us the hardest in their communities before our deployments began. But it‚Äôs hard to argue with success (e.g. data-driven community impact).

I have no doubt that the Alliance x ThriveCoin is well-positioned to solve the problem of process scalability, once ready to scale.\njrocki.bedrock:\nEach submission requires a cumbersome manual review process. Partnering with ThriveCoin saves us from this process and a host of other cumbersome processes preventing the Ambassador program from scaling.\nthrivegiraffe:\n‚Äú‚Ä¶how do you plan on managing increasingly complex coordination needs at scale?‚Äù\nI did not ask about scaling further because one of several red flags here is that a high-quality content development should not be cumbersome.\nA ‚Äúcontent development engine‚Äù should operate like a well-oiled machine. If an engine is not running well, it means there are one, several or many problems.\nWhile I do not dount that ThriveCoin can help solve for coordination at scale - to automate, incentivise and bring contributions on-chain - imo process challenges are symptomatic of other underlying issues that should be solved through a more rigorous and strategic planning process prior to scaling.\nContent Development Strategy\nthrivegiraffe:\nA more supportive approach with your feedback would be offering guiding suggestions to help us improve our Mission\nlee0007:\nAs a possible alternative to deliver the same results I would suggest you test the proposed program at a much smaller scale first to develop the onboarding process, content strategy, quality assurance processes and policies with a small inital cohort before looking to scale.

I‚Äôve specified concerns, linked you to my approach to measuring impact for content performance and offered to share work which includes my own consultancy frameworks.

Additionally, you are re-quoting yourself numerous times, making many (provably) false statements, and continuing to soft shill yourself. Thus, we believe it is highly likely you care less about our Mission and more about trying to make a name for yourself and some current or future project or ambition.\nIt is exhausting for me - and surely for any readers who have made it all the way here (thank you for sticking with us if you have) - to address all of this. I‚Äôll attempt, hopefully for a last time, to summarize my responses to your last response. Good luck with whatever you are planning!\nYou asked us to share the Ambassador content collection + performance results that we are proposing to deliver with this Mission. That will, of course, be delivered by the end of this Mission! If, instead, you want to know about Ambassador results disconnected from this Mission, @jrocki.bedrock has shared data above and can share more if you‚Äôd like. If you are wondering whether the ThriveCoin team has the background to help drive extraordinary content at scale starting from, even, nothing. We have lots of it. Here‚Äôs a Forbes article that speaks to some of my extensive background with creating high quality impact-focused content for many of the top organizations in the world. Mostly the same engineering leadership team too. This has been shared with you earlier.\nYou argue for a more rigorous strategic planning process (lots of words, but that seems to be the core). The subtext, I‚Äôm guessing, is you are seeking to frame yourself - and your project management / content lead experience - as the ‚Äúmissing piece‚Äù. As I‚Äôve clarified before, the fact that we disagree on strategy doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have a strategy (that was your first accusation in previous replies) or that our strategic planning isn‚Äôt ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù. We do have a strategy, it is rigorous, and it has - so far - proven enormously successful at a time when many communities are struggling (examples given in previous posts).\nI asked you in my last reply to ask questions to help us improve our proposal - instead of making false statements. This time you asked questions at the end of your reply, but I question whether they are in good faith. You start by saying: ‚Äúnot a single measure of how quality and impact are defined‚Äù, but before you finish your sentence you acknowledge that we did define them: ‚Äúother than in terms of quantity of contributors and content.‚Äù You also don‚Äôt acknowledge that we optimized for quality, too. In this Mission there is: a) a process for ensuring high quality Ambassador content, b) a reward tier for editorial review, and c) bot, bad actor, and farmer protection built into the tech. You then, again, use basic rhetorical techniques to try to make points disguised as questions. You qualify your questions with mis-statements like ‚ÄúWithout an understanding of impact‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt know what results you work to deliver‚Ä¶‚Äù Even you acknowledge in your own earlier words that these statements are false. Recklessly using rhetorical techniques to make points - without caring about facts - isn‚Äôt a good use of your time or mine (I am missing time with my 1 and 5 year old daughters to respond to you on this Sunday morning).\nUltimately, Lee0007, we are big fans of results speaking for themselves. This Mission is an experiment. If it doesn‚Äôt drive the impact we propose, I am confident you will be the first person to let us and the entire Optimism community know it. But if it does drive the impact we propose - or better - it can be the start of something incredibly valuable and enduring for the community. We are making an enormous investment in this Mission, we have a long track record of high performance, and this is our life‚Äôs work‚Ä¶ the impact we want to create in the world. So we feel very good about our chances of, together, creating enormous value! - Daniel',

Now serves as Ecosystem Lead at Argent wallet and sourcing and vetting content for https://web3xplorer.com 1.\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\nHaving used Optimism ourselves for some time and delved into its community, we‚Äôre genuinely excited about its potential and rooting for its success. We are committed to promoting the Optimistic Vision, as we have faith that the flourishing of the Optimism ecosystem is dependent on more users and creators endorsing this vision.\nOur game plan? Guide folks through the Ethereum landscape and introduce them to scalable and cost-effective layer 2 solutions like Optimism.\nHow? We‚Äôre making it as simple as possible for all web3 users, whether they‚Äôre old hands or total newbies, to explore web3 with our web application, Web3xplorer 1.\nWeb3xplorer is your go-to platform for all things web3. It‚Äôs got a growing list of web3 apps, resources and tools ‚Äì 32 at the moment, but we‚Äôre aiming to list over 1000 in the coming months.\nWeb3xplorer has all the features you need to quickly and easily find the right tool or app. It‚Äôs got a built-in search engine, advanced filters and sorting, and it‚Äôs mobile-friendly. It even syncs with your system‚Äôs dark or light mode. You can check it out at https://web3xplorer.com 1.\nMaxime has been hard at work on it since October 2022 (part-time), making sure it‚Äôs a speedy, SEO-friendly web app (built with NextJS, Strapi, and PostgreSQL).\nWe‚Äôre confident that Web3xplorer can help bring new people, DAOs, builders, and partners into the Optimism ecosystem. It‚Äôs all about making it easy for everyone to find out what apps, guides, learning resources, and tools are available on Optimism, and to get what Optimism is all about.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nWe make a dynamic duo with our contrasting, yet complementary, skillsets.\nMaxime, with his leap from PwC tech consultant to software developer, brings a strong foundation in software development to the table. He has hands-on experience with technologies like React/NextJS, NodeJS application development, and system administration. His current part-time gig at The Smurfs‚Äô Society has also given him a comprehensive understanding of web3.\nOn the other hand, Antoine, an ex-management consultant and former PMO at ABInbev, blends his strategic thinking and organizational skills with a rich knowledge of web3, garnered from roles such as Ecosystem Lead at Argent and his previous work at The Smurfs‚Äô Society.\nWe both got hooked on web3 and digital assets back in 2017, and it‚Äôs been a wild ride since. Watching friends, ex-colleagues, and even family navigate the web3 maze led to an idea - a curated and hand-picked web app to top-notch web3 apps, resources and tools.\nMaxime holds the responsibility for the technical development of Web3xplorer, including incorporating new features and enhancing the user interface and experience based on users‚Äô feedback. In addition, he plays a significant role in boosting our SEO and marketing game. Maxime will also assist in curating content and populating our database with pertinent web3 applications, resources, and tools. On the other hand, Antoine‚Äôs responsibility is to find and curate web3 applications, resources, and tools, and write articles (such as this one).\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nWeb3‚Äôs main hurdle right now is its complexity, making it tricky for beginners to wrap their heads around it. For a lot of people, it feels like wrestling with both the convoluted world of the internet and the complexities of finance simultaneously. Our aim is to make web3 navigation smoother and to tackle the issue of discovering the right apps, tools, and resources. We‚Äôve outlined the following milestones to help us do just that:\nMilestone 1: By July‚Äôs end, we aim to expand our listings by featuring a minimum of 500 new applications/tools/resources, with at least 150 of these actively available on Optimism. Each application listing should include a basic description, a Q&A segment to guide users, a snapshot of the website, and their Twitter and website links. Some apps might also feature links to external useful resources (e.g. video to set up a specific wallet).\nMilestone 2: By mid-August, we expect to significantly enrich the Optimism page with comprehensive information and external resource links that explain Optimism, demonstrate how to bridge, provide links to governance forums, and more. This page should also include a detailed FAQ section to assist newcomers.\nMilestone 3: By early September, we plan to establish and launch the blogging section of our website, which will serve as a crucial tool for disseminating information and resources about Optimism.\nMilestone 4: By mid-September, marking the end of the season, we should have composed and published approximately 10 detailed articles focusing on Optimism. These articles will cover topics like what a layer 2 like Optimism is, what users can anticipate from it, guides to bridging and using apps, and more.\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.\nBy July 31st, we‚Äôre aiming to list over 500 new apps, including 150 active on Optimism. That‚Äôs our goal to help grow the ecosystem.\nBy August 17th, we‚Äôll jazz up the Optimism page (Optimism | Web3xplorer 1) with much more info.\nBy September 4th, we‚Äôll have our blogging section live and kicking.\nBy September 18th, you should see around 10 articles about Optimism up on our site, linked right from Optimism‚Äôs dedicated page on Web3xplorer.\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson‚Äôs impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\nTo see how much impact this mission‚Äôs had, badgeholders can look at two main things:\nHow many unique folks visited Web3xplorer during Season 4. More visitors means more people are catching on to what we‚Äôre doing.\nThe total page views for apps that are up and running on Optimism and the Optimism page itself. This shows how much people are interacting with Optimism-related content on our site.\nWe‚Äôll supply the relevant stats and info from our web analytics tool to measure these two factors effectively.\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\nAssuming a standard workweek of 40 hours with an hourly rate of 50 OP:\nDevelopment of the blogging functionality: We‚Äôll be using NextJS and exposing blog content over an API (Strapi) while storing the data in a PostgreSQL database in markdown format. This would take about 3 weeks, or 6000 OP.\nExpanding our database: We‚Äôre planning to load up our database with a heap of new apps and tools. This would require about 4 weeks of work, which equates to 8000 OP. We estimate that each app listing will take us between 15 to 20 minutes.\nWriting blog articles: We have a target to create 10 blog pieces, which we expect will take us about 2 weeks or 4000 OP, at a rate of one article per day.\nPlease note: Some of the funds might be used to reward contributors who step up to help us find and verify content, as well as contribute towards creating awesome articles.\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: Yes\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes',

We‚Äôre working hard to make Web3xplorer a go-to spot where everyone can find what they need about Optimism (sort of like a central hub).\nDoesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a user looking for a DEX to trade your ETH for OP, a developer eager to learn how to deploy a smart contract specifically on Optimism, someone on the hunt for the right tool to inspect on-chain data, or just someone wanting to dive deeper into Optimism itself - we‚Äôre aiming to have all the bases covered.\nAlso, on top of all the handy info we‚Äôre pulling together in the Optimism world, our goal is to produce thorough and insightful articles about Optimism, particularly catering to those who are new to this sphere. These are mainly for the newbies, to help them get a grip on moving funds to Optimism, understanding what Layer 2 is all about, how Optimism‚Äôs governance rolls, and more.\nNote: I revisited the Grants Council and their call for Grants as you recommended. However, I‚Äôm leaning more towards pursuing the Token House Missions as it seems to align better with our objectives than seeking funding from the Grants Council. Of course, very much happy to discuss it!\nCheers,\nMaxime',

When we first dreamt up Web3xplorer, we thought it‚Äôd be super handy to make it a one-stop-shop for anyone digging into the vast world of Ethereum. We wanted to make life easier for anyone new to web3, helping them find everything they need in one spot.\nIn our view, this broad approach positively impacts the Optimism ecosystem‚Äôs growth. For instance, a visitor to Web3xplorer might be seeking general information about rollups or seeking solutions to Ethereum‚Äôs high gas costs. In these cases, we can guide them towards Optimism as a possible answer. Predominantly, these inquiring individuals could be beginners who might never have encountered Optimism otherwise.\nThus, by incorporating resources beyond the Optimism ecosystem, we indirectly contribute to its expansion!\nWe think the next wave of Web3 users won‚Äôt be the hardcore type who pull info from Twitter, hang out on Discord, or dig through Notion repositories. More likely, they‚Äôll be looking for something that feels like Web2. And that‚Äôs exactly where Web3xlorer shines!\nToday‚Äôs tools and solutions are pretty much designed for folks who are already clued into optimism and know exactly where to dig for the right info. Our goal, though, is to spread optimism far and wide, to an entirely new audience.',

To make this a reality, the Optimism Collective needs to extend across the Superchain. Our Mission is to evaluate possible technical implementations of the Optimism Collective across the Superchain, analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each implementation, highlight blockers, and make recommendations. This Superchain Governance Deep Dive will help accomplish Intent #1 Progress Towards Technical Decentralization by establishing a research-based foundation for the implementation of Superchain governance.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission? Our team has deep technical expertise in the area of crosschain governance specifically and the area of onchain governance in general. We built Rollcall, a protocol for crosschain voting from Optimism to L1 DAOs. We are working closely on a technical level with the Uniswap DAO as part of the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee as they manage their multichain governance deployment. Tally is the most popular front end of Governor, which is the onchain smart contract primitive that the Optimism Collective uses for governance. Tally supports Token House Governance.

Having more active and interested delegates would be a huge benefit to the Optimism Collective as a whole. But we have a problem‚Ä¶ delegates have no insight into data on their own delegation. Currently the only information that is readily available to delegates on all major websites is the total amount of OP delegated and the # of delegating addresses. This limits the agency of delegates, especially new and growing ones, and as a result limits participation in governance.\nOPdelegate.com 7 solves these problems by creating the go-to website for Optimism Delegates. Specifically, it will provide address-specific information for delegates to understand, manage, and grow their delegation on Optimism. Think ‚Äúzapper.fi for delegates‚Äù.\nExamples of statistics on this website would be:\nTotal delegation over time\nnumber of delegating addresses over time\n‚ÄúDemographics‚Äù of delegating addresses (size, activity, etc.)\nBy having access to the most important information, delegates will have the agency to see how their decisions and activity affect their delegation, leading to the opportunity to make data-driven decisions. The existence of this tool will increase overall delegate involvement in governance and provide a growth for new and growing delegates.\nWhile the initial goal of this grant is to build a wallet-specific dashboard for delegates, the ultimate goal is to be a one-stop-shop for all things Optimism delegation. All parts of the website will be open-source, meaning that this code will be available for other projects to integrate and that outside contributors will be welcome to contribute.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nMichael Vander Meiden 1\nThrough being one of the most active delegates in Optimism governance, Michael has experienced the key pain points of new and active delegates. Through hosting the community calls, Michael has been at the center of delegate discussion for almost the entire existence of the token house. Along the way, Michael has answered countless questions from and helped guide many new delegates just starting their journey. These experiences have made Michael one of the most knowledgeable within Optimism‚Äôs Token House on the delegate journey. All of this experience makes this Alliance strongly positioned to design and build the product that delegates need.\nAs far as ability to execute, Michael draws on his experience as a software engineer and later a product manager at a venture-funded startup (http://www.stockwell.ai/). There he managed a remote team to build multiple applications, most notably a delivery and stocking app that cut driver stocking times by 40%.\nHe is also a solidity engineer that has built many web3 projects and placed in multiple web3 hackathons, most notably Arbitrum‚Äôs 2022 hackathon, placing 1st in the DeFi track.\nMichael Silberling (advisor)\nMichael Silbering is a data wizard at OP Labs, and his work speaks for itself. To-date he has been instrumental in all of the most important data dashboards on Optimism and Optimism Governance. He will be serving in an advisory role for this project.\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nLaunch of Delegate Dashboard Website\nInclusion of at least 3 real-time charts to help delegates visualize their delegation data\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.\nAlpha-version published for testing (September 1st)\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson‚Äôs impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\nNumber of delegates actively using Delegate Dashboard\nNPS-score of website from delegates\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\nAll grant funds will go to Michael as a delayed reimbursement for website expenses, for which he will fund out-of-pocket for the development of the website.\nWhile Michael has the experience needed to build the website himself, he will leverage the use of 3rd-party contractors to make sure that the website meets the highest standards of quality and usefulness.\nPlanned expenses include:\nWebsite infrastructure costs\nHosting/Compute\nAPI fees\nDomain Registration\nFull Stack Dev (3rd party contractor)\nDesigner (3rd party contractor)\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: Yes\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes',

All the tools/features mentioned in the proposal are not available in Agora and the goal isn‚Äôt to be a competitor to Agora/Karma, but rather an analysis tool for Delegates and Delegators.\nThe best way to think about what is being built is ‚ÄúYoutube Analytics‚Äù + ‚ÄúZapper.fi‚Äù for delegates.\nYoutube analytics provides actionable data over time to it‚Äôs creators. When a creator posts a video, they can see the direct effects on their watch-time and subscriber base.\nFor delegates:\nCurrently, if a delegate gives a call-to-action to their community, they have no way of really tracking if that made an impact on their delegation. Imagine a protocol/project putting out regular requests to their community to ‚ÄúPlease delegate to our Op ambassador‚Äù. Currently there is no out-of-the-box solution to tracking the effectiveness of this. The only numbers that delegate aggregation platforms give are the absolute # of delegates and # of OP delegated.\nHere is an example of youtube analytics which this draws inspiration from:\nWhy is this important? By seeing how delegation changes over time based on the actions of the delegate, the delegate will gain agency to do what they discover works to gain delegation. As a whole, optimism delegates will be able to drive more participation (delegation) in governance by given access to these tools.\nIn addition, delegates will be able to get more detail on their delegator cohort. They will be able to answer questions like "Are my delegators 1 whale and a bunch of airdrop farmers? Or are they a bunch of medium-size active DeFi users? This is a great opportunity to include things like attestations into the breakdown.\nFor delegators:\nBecause this information would be public for everybody, delegators could use the same info to get a more detailed breakdown of the the delegation of potential delegates before choosing who to delegate too.\nBut to be clear, this is not a delegate discovery platform or a governance platform, it‚Äôs a research and analytics platform for delegates to use.',

Then add optimism-ecosystem events (airdrops) and then we can start adding more specific activities based on requests from delegates. It‚Äôs also important to note that this will be open source, and so if someone wants to join the development and add some integration (i.e. youtube) then they would be welcome to do that to earn any share of RPGF\nCombining on and off chain data is relatively easy if there is an API for the off-chain data and everything is time series. To start, we just want to get the data out there in a useable format‚Ä¶ delegates know what actions are happening\nIt‚Äôs important to note that we are NOT linking on-chain addresses of delegators to off-chain profiles, nor is it in the plans.

Protocols have a choice of where to deploy and Velodrome and matching our efforts with targeted incentive programs provide the most compelling case for a focused investment in the Optimistic vision.\nThat is why we believe that to grow awareness and engagement with the Optimistic Vision, we need to employ every avenue at our disposal to get access to those builders that could be of interest to Optimism. And in our experience, no amount of words or guides alone can compare with direct, in-person engagement. This grant would support Velodrome‚Äôs own considerable efforts to grow the ecosystem and provide the tools to continue to attract the best and brightest in Web3 and get them invested in the Optimistic Vision.\nWe propose 100,000 OP to be used as bounties to incentivize individuals in the Optimism community to surface and introduce new protocols to Velodrome to onboard to the Optimism Collective. We would target bounties of roughly 2k per referral. Bounties would not go to people currently employed by Optimism Labs, the Optimism Foundation, or any affiliates, nor would they go to currently titled and compensated people on the Grants Council.\nWe will pair these incentives with our ongoing efforts to promote the Optimistic Vision and ecosystem through our official comms channels (Twitter, Discord, etc), our business development activities (50+ protocols onboarded to date), and our partnership support that helps projects get engaged in governance and connect with other ecosystem builders.\nThis grant request is about equipping those already doing the work of spreading the Optimistic Vision with the demonstrated effective tools they need to be successful.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nOur Alliance‚Äôs combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this Mission\nVelodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on Layer 2 Ethereum, it is the most prominent public advocate for the Optimistic Vision across the DeFi landscape\nVelodrome has a proven record of persuading builders and users to embrace the Optimistic vision, attracting, onboarding, and retaining protocols / builders / and their communities to Optimism (50+ and counting)\nVelodrome has a demonstrated track record of running successful grant programs and delivering results, holding ourselves accountable to the metrics we lay out\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nOnboard 5 new protocols to Optimism within 12 weeks of the receipt of grant funds.\nKept records of distributions and reasons for such distributions.\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.\nOnboard 1 new, unreached protocol by week 4, 2 protocols by week 6 and 5 protocols by week 12 of 5 new projects to Optimism (or 10% of existing opportunities in biz dev pipeline)\nRecorded Twitter space or community call with each newly onboarded protocol to spread the Optimistic Vision across their community of users\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?

The total duration of the course is approximately 20+ hours. The voiceover of the course was made in Turkish. As we continue to expand our Solidity course, we would like to announce that this education is supported by the Ethereum Foundation from now on.\nGenesis Newsletter: For more than 3 years, we have been preparing a newsletter where we publish weekly blockchain news with a total of 174 different issues. A newsletter with more than 5000 active members, where you can learn about the important blockchain news of that week in 5 minutes.\nDelegation Team: This year, we established the Delegation Committee to contribute to the diversity in various protocols and to express our opinion in the governance voting. Thus, we actively participate in voting in the networks we are Delegates and share our rationale both on governance forums and on Twitter.\nOur Tally Profile 2\nRationale Twitter Floods\nOptimism 1 1\nOptimism 2 1\nOptimism 3\nArbitrum 1\nArbitrum 2\ndYdX\nStarknet 1\n2022-2023 Academic Year Update: As with every year, many new members joined us this year. We reserved our first semester in the academic calendar for trainings and meeting with our community. So far, we have held 6 face-to-face trainings, 3 workshops, and 3 meetings between members. In other words, we have done activities in 12 weeks of the 14-week period.\nOur Socials:\nTwitter 1\nInstagram\nGithub\nPlease explain how this Mission will help accomplish the above Intent:\nAs ITU Blockchain, Turkey‚Äôs first and largest Web3 society, we have been a part of many events and organizations over the past five years. The main lesson we learned during this time was the importance of ‚ÄúCreating a sustainable community model‚Äù.\nThis approach, coupled with an optimistic vision, has strengthened the sustainable community model we created using the activity-community-engagement triangle, bringing it to an ‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù of sorts. We now aim to use the knowledge and model that ITU Blockchain has built around Istanbul, having established more than 40 Blockchain communities in Turkey, and make it a foundational building block of Web3 Public Goods.\nIn order to reach the Optimistic Vision and establish communication with people abroad to share our values, ITU Blockchain members face challenges in terms of both visas and finances in Turkey. We aim to overcome these challenges by sending individuals who can grasp both blockchain and the Optimistic Vision to events such as ETHCC, providing them with opportunities for personal development. Afterward, we plan to organize local network events and share their experiences through ITU Blockchain‚Äôs social channels to raise awareness and educate our ecosystem.\nAdditionally, many builders will become aware of the value of producing public goods and contributing to the ecosystem. The networks created will allow Optimistic Vision to spread to individuals around the globe, starting from the builders in the hacker house.\nFollowing this milestone, we aspire to create sustainable Web3 Communities that can grow cumulatively. We plan to organize many activities we have conducted previously, this time beyond our local communities, all along the activity-community-engagement axis. Of course, we intend to do all of this with our Optimistic Vision!\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nITU Blockchain stands as a force that challenges existing power structures and works towards a more equitable and sustainable future. Our mission is driven by a steadfast commitment to defending the public interest and advocating for the empowerment of marginalized communities. With a focus on fostering innovation and collaboration, we aim to build a model that transcends conventional boundaries and embraces a vision of regenerative finance and public goods.\nAs an ITU Blockchain, an ideal alliance for the Optimistic Vision, aligns with its goals and principles. Through workshops and events, we continuously learn and develop skills, staying ahead of blockchain advancements. With a vast network within Istanbul Technical University and the Turkish blockchain industry, we can mobilize stakeholders for effective execution. Our synergy with impact-driven growth and collaborative governance drives the creation of a productive and empathetic economy. ITU Blockchain‚Äôs expertise, resources, and alignment with the Optimistic Vision make us well-suited to achieve its objectives, creating a collaborative and prosperous digital ecosystem.\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nWe are going to have mainly 2 milestones:\nETH CC Participation:\nA team of at least 6 individuals from our community will attend ETH CC, representing our commitment to the Optimistic Vision. During the conference, our delegates will actively engage with other participants, attend relevant sessions, and immerse themselves in the latest developments in the blockchain ecosystem. Through their participation, they will gain valuable insights, establish connections, and further enhance their understanding of the Optimistic Vision.\nAmplifying the Optimistic Vision through Engaging Digital Content:\nYouTube | Producing Engaging Videos to Educate and Inspire\nWe will create captivating YouTube videos dedicated to exploring the core principles and potential impact of the Optimistic Vision. These videos will present the concepts in an accessible and visually appealing manner, catering to a wide range of viewers. By leveraging the power of video content, we aim to captivate and educate our audience, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Optimistic Vision.\nTwitter | Interactive Discussions and Community Engagement\nWe will utilize the power of Twitter to host interactive discussions and engage with our community. Through Twitter Spaces, we will facilitate live conversations, allowing participants to ask questions, share ideas, and provide valuable feedback. By actively engaging with our audience, we aim to create a vibrant online community centered around the Optimistic Vision, where knowledge is exchanged and connections are formed.\nMedium Articles | In-depth Insights and Thought Leadership\nOur team will produce well-researched and thought-provoking Medium articles that delve into the nuances and intricacies of the Optimistic Vision. These articles will provide readers with in-depth insights, analysis, and practical guidance on embracing the principles of public goods and regenerative finance. By publishing on Medium, we will establish ourselves as thought leaders in the field, attracting a diverse audience and stimulating discussions around the Optimistic Vision.\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission:\nBy the end of season 4, the number of content views will be higher than 2000. Assess the quality and quantity of interactions and discussions related to the Optimistic Vision on social media platforms. Viewers of contents > 2000\nKeep track of the number of individuals from ITU Blockchain who attend ETHCC to learn about the Optimistic Vision. Ensure that at least six people participate in the event and actively engage with the sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities related to the Optimistic Vision. And gender equality will be given importance in people going to ETHCC.\nAttendees to ETH CC from ITU Blockchain > 6\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\nIn the Turkish ecosystem, Sharing knowledge from ETHCC and mentioning at local networking events aimed at promoting Optimistic Vision within the ITU Blockchain community and then seeing other people‚Äôs views on optimistic vision on social media\nAssess the growth of ITU Blockchain‚Äôs network and partnerships as a result of participating in ETHCC and sharing experiences through social media channels. Measure the number of new connections made, collaborations initiated, and partnerships formed with other organizations or individuals who share the Optimistic Vision and values.\nEvaluate the reach and impact of the knowledge shared through Medium articles and YouTube video. Monitor the number of views, likes, comments, and shares on these platforms. Analyze the feedback and comments to gauge the level of understanding and interest generated among the target audience.\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\n10k OPs will be dedicated to incentivizing a team of 6 representatives to ETHCC. We are aware that our friends who will go to ETH CC with us will have various expenses. We want to encourage our members with the allocated part of the grant we will receive from here. After the grant is delivered to our members whose participation in the event is certain, the allocated portion will be given as an incentive. By actively participating in ETHCC, we aim to gain visibility, attract potential partners and contributors, and promote the principles of public goods and regenerative finance.\n15K OPs The portion of the grant allocated here will also be distributed as an incentive to our community members who will produce our content. In this process, the distribution portion will be decided by the Alliance Members based on how much effort the community members put into it.\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: Yes\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes',

You may have caught something here.\nThe proposal was initially inspired when collateral was not enabled for OP.\nIt is now listed in isolation mode ‚Äì meaning users can only borrow stablecoins against it (not OP) and therefore limiting the inflation of voting power.\nIn such an environment, when a user deposits OP into Aave - it is held in the Optimism market and stays in the smart contract ‚Äì what the receive is a reflection of their stake (or if desired, stables)\nIt seems like isolation mode for OP has been enabled by risk managers and I must have missed this change; my apologies here. In theory, one could deposit OP, borrow stables, swap to OP, and repay.\nBut there is a strict limit in how much debt is allowed; currently borrows is low, around $60k.\nAs most changes are up to Governance in Aave, there is opportunity to disable isolation mode and borrowing altogether though not sure how it would be received.\nLet me think more about this ‚Äì please standby.\nOk sharing more of my thoughts for the sake of collective learning and transparency.\nThis is what a transaction looks like in isolation mode:\nSupplied 1 OP, borrowed 10% and received .10 DAI.\nWith a debt limit of 2mm ‚Äî the maximum inflation of the voting power would be about 1MM OP.\nThis makes sense for Aave as it encourages more deposits, borrows, and use cases but may not be in the best interest of the OP Collective; it is up to the community decide if worth pursuing.\nIt does however, IMO encourage more Governance accessibility, allowing more users and even borrowing in some cases; this is present in other DAOs and communities.\nI‚Äôll let this stay up for a bit, but if not additional interest it may not be the right time.',

I hope this outline CC0 might present an opportunity to others in the community, happy to help if needed but this is public, forkable info.\nWhy: Our Collective Voice\nThe Optimistic Vision has inspired a diverse global community that underpins, supports and strengthens our shared Optimistic Vision. If ‚Äú‚Ä¶small things can have non-linear impacts on a complex system‚Ä¶‚Äù then what impact could 100, 1000,10,000 coordinated voices, proactively sharing our message have? Awareness\nI believe our collective voice can best deliver impact through a coordinated, timebound social awareness campaign.The effort is proposed as entirely voluntary, however, on-chain signatures and attestation to record and quantify commitment to and alignment with the Optimistic Vision could in future contribute to (a possible prerequisite for) Citizen House membership\nCollective Intents\nIncreased awareness should onboard new people, DAOs, builders, and partners who are passionate about our vision and values to the ecosystem, some of which may be outside Web3.\nMissions could include targeted educational resources, focused hackathons or conferences, and/or specific marketing efforts aimed at growing a community of value-aligned Optimists.\nThe challenge with incentivising awareness is that as a top-of-the-funnel initiative it is inherently difficult to attribute or quantify resulting impact without the type of comprehensive tracking tools that run somewhat counter to web3 ownership (data) and privacy values. And so I propose we establish a method to help quantify ‚Äúawareness‚Äù that drives engagement and social reach. I suggest the following two tools could help us baseline ‚Äúawareness of the vision‚Äù so that we can track future growth.\nHow: Tools to Quantify Awareness\n1.

As I lack the technical skills I recognise that this may be much harder than it sounds. My reasoning for proposing is to find people with the skills and bandwidth for the work.\nWe have a community of thousands and if everyone spent 30 minutes I hope we could achieve significant social reach and ‚Äúawareness‚Äù at minimal cost.

As well as the downside of reducing the value of the attestation, this would also remove the possibility of using the data on the number of signers to talk about the real engagement with the OP Vision.\nIn my opinion either adding some kind of Sybil resistance mechanism; or making the user pay a token amount; or removing the attestation aspect, would make this a stronger idea.

We need to find more ways to get OP in the hands of the right kinds of users and builders. Protocols and users with a strong understanding of Optimism‚Äôs ecosystem possess valuable insights that can contribute to informed decision-making within the governance process. Their expertise and knowledge would ensure that governance decisions are made with a deep understanding of their potential implications, and would help promote an effective, sustainable, and diverse governance structure.\nVelodrome will run a 10 to 12-week program that will delegate and distribute vested OP tokens to 1) newly onboarded, high-profile protocols that commit to take an active role in Optimism Governance and 2) users with demonstrated ecosystem alignment through token locks, such as veVELO locks, and active engagement in protocol governance.\nProtocols and veVELO holders have a strong alignment to Optimism‚Äôs success, deep understanding of the Optimism ecosystem, and overall advanced awareness of the crypto landscape.\nVelodrome is uniquely positioned to engage high-profile protocols and veVELO holders to take an active role in Governance, which would significantly boost the Governance Accessibility goals in the following ways:\nEffective Knowledge Sharing: Users with a strong understanding of Optimism can play a crucial role in facilitating better knowledge sharing among the community. By actively engaging with other participants and sharing their expertise, they can contribute to the development of more informed voters. This will enhance the overall understanding of Optimism governance and enable a diverse range of perspectives to participate meaningfully.\nIncreased Votable Supply and Reduced Concentration of Voting Power: Allocating vested tokens to lockers and protocols, conditional their active participation in governance processes, will ensure wider token distribution and encourage broader diversity of viewpoints. This will dilute the concentration of voting power, promoting a more democratic and equitable governance structure.\nFresh Perspective: Users with a strong alignment to Optimism but limited experience in Governance can provide feedback on the user interfaces and tools used for interacting with governance programs. By sharing their experiences and suggestions, they can help identify areas of improvement and advocate for user-friendly designs that enhance accessibility for all participants.\nDemonstrated Engagement: New protocols incentivizing on Velodrome and new veVelo lockers have recently made a significant investment in the Optimism ecosystem. They are primed to make a further investment in the success of that ecosystem through active participation in governance, especially when tied to vested incentives. New protocols will be able to be onboarded to governance immediately as a bridge to a future protocol delegation program allocation. New individual users are a captive audience we can connect immediately to resources and educational opportunities in OP governance. This will be one of the easiest to reach audiences compared to other outreach channels.\nVelodrome will accomplish the mission by providing an end-to-end governance onboarding experience for both protocols and veVelo lockers, including infrastructure to claim and delegate vested OP. We will leverage our comprehensive experience in vesting contract implementations for governance to develop a new contract standard - govNFT - that enables the vesting and distribution of OP tokens contained within a govNFT. This standard will offer customization options including:\nVesting Time: Protocols will have the flexibility to specify the duration over which the tokens vest. They can set the timeline according to their requirements.\nTransferrability: Users will have the option to choose whether the vested tokens can be transferred to other addresses or remain non-transferrable, ensuring control over the token‚Äôs movement.\nUnlock Mechanics: Users will be able to decide whether the vested tokens unlock periodically over time or all at once after the vesting period expires. This feature provides flexibility and allows for strategic unlocking of tokens.\nAdditionally, the team will develop a user-friendly dashboard that will allow govNFT holders to delegate their positions and conveniently track relevant information, such as the remaining vesting time.\nBy implementing govNFTs, Optimism and associated protocols can incentivize and reward users with a long-term focus, ensuring the no-sale rule is enforced and contributing to a sustainable and stable ecosystem.\nWe will make all of our implementations available for all Optimism protocols to use. Our progress milestones detail the process. Beyond the delegation we will have dedicated communication channels on Discord and Telegram to keep new delegates up to date on key voting cycles and participation opportunities.\nAs we have done for our other grants, we will lead the way on grant use analytics and pioneer methods for tracking governance participation that can be used for our grant and other grants provided under this mission.\nWhat makes your Alliance well-suited to execute this Mission?\nVelodrome‚Äôs combined experiences make us well prepared to execute on this Mission:\nVelodrome is the single largest protocol on Optimism and the largest DEX on Layer 2 Ethereum\nVelodrome‚Äôs governance community is one of the most active and diverse in crypto, with 14,300 veVELO holders participating in Velodrome‚Äôs weekly voting epochs\nveVELO holders, by virtue of their long-term locks, are uniquely committed to the success of the broader the ecosystem. The average lock time for veVELO positions is 3.6 years, and veVELO participants include leading protocols such as Synthetix, Stargate, and Lido\nVelodrome has proven record of both educating and attracting new protocols to Optimism, successfully onboarding over 50 protocols since inception at a rate of approximately one new protocol per week\nVelodrome has also been a continued partner in monitoring and analytics for grants, holding ourselves accountable to the metrics we lay out\nPlease list a critical milestone. The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you‚Äôve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back.\nDevelop a process for delegating vested OP to new protocols and users\nOnboard at least 3 major protocols to participate in Optimism governance through vote delegation and engagement in active discussions (ideally new to Optimism)\nIncrease diversity of experienced governance participants in Optimism, as measured by the number of veVELO lockers eligible for this program, by at least 100 members by week 5\nHow should Token House delegates measure progress towards this Mission: These should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended.\nAppropriate infrastructure for tracking and delegation developed by week 4 after receipt of the grant\nEnlist at least one protocol in governance participation by week 5 of the program, 2 protocols by week 7, and 3 protocols by week 10\nMeasure increased governance activity through voting and comments from relevant protocols and veVELO holders in our communication channels\nMeasure quality of feedback and information sharing by veVELO lockers active simultaneously in Optimism governance and Velodrome governance\nHow should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission? These should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson‚Äôs impact in the next round of RetroPGF.\nPositive feedback or testimonials from onboarded protocols\nIncreased number of wallets directly linked to this Mission participating in Optimism Governance\nIncrease in comments and proposals from engaged Velodrome community members\nAnalytical framework for tracking governance participation through this program\nBreakdown of Mission budget request:\nDevelopment of govNFT contracts, dashboard and admin: 350K OP\nProtocols activated on Optimism governance: 250K OP\nveVELO Governance govNFT Lock Bonus: 400K OP\nI confirm that my grant will be subject to clawback for failure to execute on critical milestones: Yes\nI confirm that I have read and understand the grant policies: Yes\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\nI understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes',
